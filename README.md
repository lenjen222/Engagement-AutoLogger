# Engagement-AutoLogger
A Macro that takes relevant info from a master downloaded file and puts that information into a different open excel file.

At Thomson Reuters, associates are stuck doing repetitive, error-prone tasks. One of the most frustrating was maintaining the engagement log: every binder required manually copy-pasting three fields (client name, binder ID, page count) from a downloaded spreadsheet into a log Excel file.

Each entry = three Ctrl-C / Ctrl-V cycles.

Even downloading the “pending binders” export only reduced the steps slightly.

It was tedious, archaic, and ripe for mistakes.

Following the tax extension season, I've decided to build a binder autologger that will solve this problem for Thomson Reuters, or any other individual who needs to copy columns of information from one xlsx file to another. I estimate this autologger will save up to 5 minutes a day per associate, or 14 man hours a day during peak tax season.
